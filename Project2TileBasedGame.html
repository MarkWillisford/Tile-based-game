<!-- Prog 209 Project 2: Tile Based Game -->
<!-- Mark Willisford -->
<!-- Due: 19Feb17 -->
<!-- 17Jan17 -->
<!-- 18Jan17 UPDATE LOG; Added the fighting function and fixed a minor error in the final score math. Added the creeper, creeper AI, such as it is,
		an audio file that plays when the creeper gets you. If you've ever played Minecraft then you should recognize it. Start screen using the model
		class, Rock and roll. Time to validate. One last thing I may want to add is changing the players image tile based on if they have a sword or 
		armor. That is why the images are already part of the project, not sure when I'll get around to it. -->
